# Homegrad

Recently there was a leak of the homigrad build, I played with my friends on this build, there were pros and cons, but basically there MAY BE backdoors in the build left by the main developer, I decided to make my own homigrad, or my own “Murder” mode based on the “Homicide” mode.

![Banner of Why](https://github.com/sekta2/homegrad/blob/main/images/hm_banner_3.png?raw=true)

Why this particular mode?
1. When I wanted to play Homigrad with friends, both of them (hosters) had to download the entire assembly from Github
I wanted to make it so that you could download the mode from the Workshop and just play, and so that others would not have to download the mode too, because it downloads automatically.
2. Homigrad's code is terrible, there is so much bad code in it that any normal coder would have a stroke.
This is why Homegrad is being developed, which contains more or less normal and pleasant code.
