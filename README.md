Recently there was a leak of the Homigrad build, I played with my friends on this build, there were pros and cons, but basically there MAYBE backdoors in the build left by the main developer, I decided to make my own gamemode, or my own “Homicide” gamemode based on the “Murder” gamemode.

Why this gamemode?
1. When I wanted to play Homigrad with friends, both of them (hosters) had to download the entire repository from Github.
I wanted to make it so that you could download the mode from the Workshop and just play, and so that others would not have to download the mode too, because it downloads automatically.
2. Homigrad's code is terrible, there is so much bad code in it that any normal coder would have a stroke.
This is why Homegrad is being developed, which contains more or less normal and pleasant code.
